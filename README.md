## Overview

Advent of Code is an annual event where participants are given a series of coding puzzles to solve, starting on December 1st and running through December 25th. The puzzles range in difficulty, and each day unlocks two new challenges.

In this repository, you'll find my solutions for each day of Advent of Code 2024. The code is organized by day, and I have attempted to solve the problems in a clean and efficient way.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

Each day's folder contains:
- `part1/main.py`: The solution for Part 1 of the day's challenge.
- `part2/main.py`: The solution for Part 2 of the day's challenge.
- `part1/input.txt`: The input data used to solve the puzzle for the first challenge of the day.
- `part2/input.txt`: The input data used to solve the puzzle for the second challenge of the day.

## How to Run the Solutions

To run the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advent-of-code-2024.git
    cd advent-of-code-2024
    ```

2. Navigate to the appropriate day and part folder. For example, to run Part 1 of Day 1:
    ```bash
    cd day01/part1
    ```

3. Run the solution for that part. For Python:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. If you want to solve Part 2, just navigate to the `part2` folder:
    ```bash
    cd ../part2
    python main.py
    ```

5. You can find the input for each day's puzzle in the `input.txt` file for that day. You may need to replace this with the actual input for each specific day if you're testing locally.

## Languages Used

The solutions in this repository are written in the following languages:

- Python
